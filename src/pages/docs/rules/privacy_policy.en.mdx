# Ourmoe Privacy Policy


## About this Privacy Policy

**When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.**

Ourmoe ("OURMOE", "we", "our", or "us") greatly recognizes and values the privacy of people ("you" or "user"), who visit our websites, use or access our services, including but not limited to software systems, customer supporting, and community services. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.

Ourmoe may periodically modify, adjust or revise the terms of this Privacy Policy due to change of the Ourmoe Services or update in applicable laws and regulatory requirements. You acknowledge and agree to check the updated terms of this Privacy Policy regularly. If you have any questions about the updated terms of this Privacy Policy, please contact us using the contact details provided in “[Contact us](#contact-us)” of this Privacy Policy. By continuing to use the Ourmoe Services you acknowledge that you have read and understood how we process your personal data according to the updated Privacy Policy.

Our Privacy Policy was updated on November 10, 2023. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.

## What information we collect and how we use it

### 1.1 What information we collect

We will ask you to provide personal information that is necessary for us to provide our services to you. We will only collect the information that is necessary for specified, concrete, explicit, and legitimate purposes and shall ensure that the information is not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. You have the right to choose whether or not to provide the information we have requested, but in most cases, if you do not provide your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to your queries.

Depending on the service you choose, we may collect the following types of information:

#### 1.1.1 Information you provide to us

We may collect any personal information you provide to us, which is necessary for the service you choose. For example, you may provide your gender, security-related information, and other information if you create an account; you may provide us your nickname, email address, photos, videos or other needed information if you enter into promotional activities; you may provide your name, mobile phone number, and address if you engage with us, our content, or our marketing, or win a prize.

#### 1.1.2 Information We Collect and Process (either directly from users or through a third party)

- **Account Registration Information**: When you create the Account, we may collect your username, email address, mobile phone number, password, verification code and Open ID, to help you create and manage the Account for your use of our services, provide login services and link your existing Account with your social media accounts.

- **Connected Social Media Account Information (Third Party)**: If you choose to log in to our services via your social media account(s), we may receive your social media account information from third party social media providers (such as QQ, WeChat, Xbox, Discord, YouTube). Such information obtained from third party social media providers will be added to your account information.

- **Internet Protocol (IP) Address and Device Data**: We may collect data about the platform and device on which your Account is used, such as platform type (iOS/Android), device name/model and your IP address. We use this data to provide service, ensure security and allow you to connect to our servers.

- **User Service Information**: When you seek our technical and/or customer service support and/or exercise any of your legal rights as the data subject, we may collect the information that you provide in communications with our support team.

- **Advertising Information**: Advertising ID and select device information, we store the Advertising ID for that advertisement and the other device information with your profile to track the success of our advertising and marketing programs. Besides, for the iOS version, after taking appropriate technical security measures (such as encryption and hashing) to de-identify your email address, including email address collected from third party social media providers when you log in via your social media account(s), we may use your de-identified email address to track the success of our advertising and marketing programs.

- **Other Information Subject to Specific Notice**: For some websites, apps, or services provided by us, we may collect additional information beyond the above listed information. We will develop individual privacy notices to inform you how we process your personal data when you use that specific service. Such individual privacy notices will prevail in terms of the personal data processed for such individual services.

When you use or interact with third-party services that may be available on our services, such as third-party social media widgets, share buttons, and/or login mechanisms, this Privacy Policy does not and will not extend to such features, which shall be subject to the respective third-party privacy policies.

#### 1.1.3 Information We Automatically Collect

To ensure security and stable operation, provide a fair gaming environment, prevent cheating and improve the functionality and quality of Ourmoe services, we may automatically collect data using mechanisms like cookies, browser web storage, and application data caches. The categories of data we automatically collect include device-related data (including Android ID, package name, device model, OS version, bluetooth name, ISP type(name), screen resolution, user ID, Google Ads ID and app set ID (for Android)) and data related to bugs, errors, crashes and diagnosis, and other data related to security.

In specific cases, we may collect other personal data apart from the categories stated herein based on your consent or other legal bases. When this occurs, we will provide more information about any change to the way or purpose of our collection or processing which might be different from or not clarified in the details in this Privacy Policy.

#### 1.1.4 Non-personally identifiable information

We may also collect other types of information which are not directly or indirectly linked to an individual and which may not be defined as personal information according to applicable local laws. Such information is called non-personally identifiable information. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personally identifiable information. Here are some examples of information that we collect and how we may use it in a non-personally identifiable aggregated format:

- This information may include statistical data generated when you use a specific service (e.g. non-identifiable device-related information, daily usage, page visits, page access duration, and session events).

- Network monitoring data (e.g. request time, number of requests or error requests, etc.).

- App crash events (e.g. the logs automatically generated after an app crashes).

The purpose of such collection is to improve the services we provide to you. The type and amount of information collected depends on how you use our products and/or services.

We aggregate this information to provide you with more useful information and understand which parts of our websites, products, and services you are most interested in. For example, we may need to know the number of users who are active in a day, but don't need to know who is active in that day, and thus aggregated data is enough for statistical analysis. We will endeavor to isolate your personal data from non-personally identifiable information and ensure that the two types of data are used separately. However, if we combine non-personally identifiable information with personal information, such combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.

#### 1.2 How we use the personal information that we collect

The purpose of collecting personal information is to provide you with products and/or services, and to ensure that we comply with applicable laws, regulations and other regulatory requirements. This involves:

- **Providing, processing, maintaining, improving, and developing our products and/or services to you**, such as delivery, activation, verification, after-sales support, customer support, and advertising.

- **Implementing and maintaining security safeguards for the purpose of preventing loss and fraud**, such as identifying users and verifying user identity. We use your information for anti-fraud purposes only when the following two conditions are met: it is necessary, and the data used for evaluation is in accordance with the legitimate interests of Ourmoe to protect users and services.

- **Handling your questions or requests about devices and services**, such as answering customer inquiries, sending system and app notifications, and managing your involvement in events and promotions (e.g. sweepstakes).

- **Conducting relevant promotional activities, such as providing marketing and promotional materials and updates**. If you no longer wish to receive certain types of promotional materials, you may opt out by the method provided in the message (such as the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the message) unless otherwise specified under applicable laws. Please also see "[Your rights](#your-rights)" below.

- **Internal purposes**, such as data analysis, research, and development of statistical information related to the use of our products or services to improve our products or services. For example, machine learning or model algorithm training is performed after de-identification processing.

- **Optimizing the performance of your device**, such as analyzing the memory usage or the CPU utilization of your apps.

- **Storing and maintaining information related to you for our business operations** (such as business statistics) **or for fulfilling our legal obligations**.

For example, to ensure the security of our services, and to help us further understand the performance of our apps, we may record relevant information, such as the frequency of your usage, crash log information, overall usage, performance data, and app source. To prevent unauthorized vendors from unlocking devices, we may collect the Ourmoe Account ID, serial number and IP address of the operated computer and the serial number and device info of your mobile device.

- **Providing services locally on terminal devices** that do not require communication with our servers, such as using Notes on your device.

- **Other purposes with your consent**.


## How we use cookies and other technologies

Technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and pixel tags are used by Ourmoe and our third party service providers and business partners (for more information see "[How we share, transfer, and publicly disclose your personal information](#how-we-share-transfer-and-publicly-disclose-your-personal-information)" below). These technologies are used for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. These technologies help us better understand users' behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.

-  **Log files**: As true of most websites, we gather certain information and store it in log files. This information may include IP address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we gather about you.

-  **Local storage** – HTML5/Flash: We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 or Flash to store content and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our sites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 or Flash cookies to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tool for removing HTML5 LSOs. You can click here to manage your Flash Cookies.

-  **Advertising cookies**: We partner with our third party service providers and business partners (for more information see "How we share, transfer, and publicly disclose your personal information" below) to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party service providers and business partners may use advertising cookies to collect information about your online activities and interests and provide you with advertisements that correlate most highly to your profile and interests. We will obtain your prior explicit consent and involve a clear affirmative action before providing this advertising service to you. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt out by changing [your cookie settings](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com).

-  **Mobile analytics**: Within some of our mobile apps we use analytics cookies to collect information about how visitors use our website. These cookies collect information such as how often you use the app, the events that occur within the app, aggregated usage, performance data, and where crashes occur within the app. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the app.

## How we store and protect your personal information

### 4.1 Security safeguards

We are committed to keeping your personal information secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or other similar risks, we have put in place all legally required physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on your personal computer and on Ourmoe websites. We will ensure that we safeguard your personal information in accordance with applicable laws.

For example, when you access your Ourmoe Account, you can choose to use our two-step verification program for better security, and we highly recommend that you do so. When your personal information is being transmitted between your Ourmoe device and our servers, we make sure the data is encrypted by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and appropriate encryption algorithms.

All your personal information is stored on secure servers and protected in controlled facilities. We classify your information based on importance and sensitivity and ensure that your personal information has the required level of security. We have special access controls for cloud-based data storage, and we regularly review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against any unauthorized access and use.

We conduct due diligence on business partners and third-party service providers to make sure that they are able to protect your personal information. We also check that appropriate security standards are maintained by these third parties by putting in place appropriate contractual restrictions, and where necessary, carrying out audits and assessments. In addition, our employees and those of our business partners and third-party service providers who access your personal information are subject to enforceable contractual obligations of confidentiality.

We conduct security and privacy protection training courses and tests to enhance our employees' awareness of the importance of protecting personal information. We will take all practicable and legally required steps to safeguard your personal information. However, you should be aware that the use of the Internet is not entirely secure, and for this reason, we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any personal information when transferred from you or to you via the Internet.

We handle personal data breaches as required by applicable data protection law which includes, where required, notifying the breach to the relevant data protection supervisory authority and data subjects.

### 4.2 What you can do

You can set a unique password for Ourmoe services and not disclose your password or account information to anybody (unless such a person is duly authorized by you) to avoid password leaks to other websites which may harm your account security at Ourmoe. Whenever possible, do not disclose the verification codes you receive to anyone (including those who claim to be Ourmoe customer service). Whenever you sign in as a Ourmoe Account user on Ourmoe websites, particularly on somebody else's computer or on public Internet terminals, you should always sign out at the end of your session.

Ourmoe cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by a third party accessing your personal information as a result of your failure to keep your personal information private. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you must notify us immediately if there is any unauthorized use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security. Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your personal information.

### 4.3 Retention policy

We retain personal information for the period necessary for the purpose of the information collection described in this Privacy Policy or any separate privacy policy provided for a specific product or service, or as required by applicable laws. Detailed retention periods are specified in the specific service or related product page. We will cease to retain and delete or anonymize personal information once the purpose of collection is fulfilled, or after we confirm your request for erasure, or after we terminate the operation of the corresponding product or service. Where possible, we have indicated how long we typically retain identified categories, types, or items of personal data. When deciding on these retention periods, we took into account the following criteria:

- The amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information.

- The risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure.

- The purposes for which we process the personal information and how long we need the particular data to achieve these purposes.

- For how long the personal information is likely to remain accurate and up to date.

- For how long the personal information might be relevant to possible future legal claims.

- Any applicable legal, accounting, reporting, or regulatory requirements that specify how long certain records must be kept.

Depending on your jurisdiction, there may be an exception to this for personal information that we are processing for public interest, scientific, historical research, or statistical purposes. Ourmoe may continue to retain this type of information for longer than its standard retention period, where necessary and permitted based on applicable laws or your request, even if further data processing is not related to the original purpose of collection.


## Your rights

**You have the ability to control your personal information**.

### 5.1 Your rights to your personal information

Depending on applicable laws and regulations, you may have the right to access, rectification, erasure (and certain other rights) in relation to personal information that we hold about you (hereinafter referred to as the request). These rights will be subject to specific exclusions and exceptions under applicable laws.

It will help us to process your request most efficiently if it meets the following conditions:

1. The request is submitted through Ourmoe's exclusive request channel detailed above and for the protection of your information security, your request should be in writing (unless the local law explicitly recognizes the oral request);

2. You provide sufficient information to enable Ourmoe to verify your identity and ensure that you are the data subject or legally authorized to act on the data subject's behalf.

Once we obtain sufficient information to confirm that your request can be processed, we shall proceed to respond to your request within any timeframe set out under your applicable data protection laws.

In detail:

- You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your personal information and your rights. This is why we are providing you with the information in this Privacy Policy.

- Based on the requirements of applicable laws, a copy of your personal information collected and processed by us will be provided to you upon your request free of charge. For any extra requests for relevant information, we may charge a reasonable fee based on actual administrative costs according to and if permitted by the applicable laws.

- If any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, you are entitled to have your personal information corrected or completed based on the purpose of use.

- Based on the requirements of applicable laws, you have the right to request the deletion or removal of your personal information where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it. We shall consider the grounds regarding your erasure request and take reasonable steps, including technical measures. Please note that we may not be able to immediately remove the information from the backup system due to applicable law and/or technological limitations. If this is the case, we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until the backup can be deleted or be made anonymous.

- You have the right to object to certain types of processing, including processing for direct marketing (including where profiling is used), and under certain circumstances where the legal basis for processing (including profiling) is in our legitimate interests.

Particularly under the laws of some jurisdictions:

•- You have the right to request us to restrict the processing of your personal information. We shall consider the grounds regarding your restriction request. If the grounds apply under the GDPR, we shall only process your personal information under applicable circumstances under the GDPR and inform you before the restriction of processing is lifted.

- You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.

- You have the right to apply for your personal information in a structured, commonly used format and transmit the information to another data controller (data portability).

We have the right to refuse to process requests or only comply in part with requests where an exemption applies or we are otherwise entitled to do so under applicable laws, such as if the request is manifestly unfounded or manifestly excessive or it would require the disclosure of information about third parties. In some circumstances, we may charge a fee, where permitted under applicable laws. If we believe that certain aspects of a request to delete the information may result in our inability to legally use the information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or reasons permitted by applicable law, it may also be rejected.

### 5.2 Withdrawal of consent

You may withdraw your consent previously provided to us for a particular purpose by submitting a request, including collecting, using, and/or disclosing your personal information in our possession or control. Based on the specific service you are using, you can contact us on help@service.our.moe. We will process your request within a reasonable time from when the request was made, and thereafter not collect, use, and/or disclose your personal information as per your request.

Depending on the extent of your withdrawal of consent, please note that you may not be able to continue receiving the full benefit of Ourmoe's products and services. The withdrawal of your consent or authorization will not affect the validity of our processing carried out on the basis of the consent up until the point of withdrawal.

### 5.3 Canceling a service or account

If you wish to cancel a specific product or service, you can contact us via help@service.our.moe.

If you wish to cancel the Ourmoe Account, please note that the cancellation will prevent you from using the full range of Ourmoe products and services. Cancellation may be prevented or delayed in certain circumstances.

When you sign in to Ourmoe through a third-party account, you need to apply for cancellation of the account from the third party.


## How your personal information is transferred globally

Ourmoe processes and backs up personal information through a global operating and control infrastructure. Currently, Ourmoe has data centers in China, the United States, and Russia. For the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, your information may be transferred to these data centers in accordance with applicable law.

We may also transfer your personal information to third-party service providers and business partners and your data may therefore also be transmitted to other countries or regions. The jurisdiction in which these global facilities are located may or may not protect personal information to the same standards as in your jurisdiction. There are different risks under different data protection laws. However, this does not change our commitment to comply with this Privacy Policy and to protect your personal information.

In particular,

- The personal information that we collect and generate in operations on the Chinese mainland is stored in data centers located on the Chinese mainland, except for cross-border transmissions as permitted by applicable law.

- The personal information we collect and generate in our operations in Russia is processed and stored in data centers located in Russia, except for cross-border transmissions permitted under Russian law.

If we need to transfer personal information outside of your jurisdiction, whether to our affiliates or third-party service providers, we will comply with related applicable laws. We ensure that all such transfers meet the requirements of applicable local data protection laws by implementing uniform safeguards. You can contact us on help@service.our.moe to learn more about our security mechanisms.


## Age Limits and Children Protection

You represent that you are not a child under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 (or other age threshold required by local laws) are not allowed to create any Account for the Ourmoe Services. If you are 13 above but are considered a minor in your country (e.g. under 18 years old in some jurisdictions), you must have your parent or legal guardian read through this Privacy Policy with you and you represent that you have obtained the permission of your parent or guardian to create your Account.

If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor in your country, please make sure that you have read this Privacy Policy before allowing your children to create their own accounts or to use the Services. You agree that you will be subject to this Privacy Policy and be responsible for your children’s activities while using the Ourmoe Services. You agree to supervise your children’s use of the Ourmoe Services and make sure that your children only view the contents that are age appropriate to your children.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we recognize that we have a special obligation to protect children in regard to the collection and processing of personal data. We strongly urge parents and guardians to instruct their children never to disclose or give out their personal data when using our services without the prior permission of their parent/guardian. If we learn that we have collected personal data about a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data as quickly as possible. Also, if you believe that we might have any data from or about a child, please contact us using the contact details under the "[Contact and Complaint](#contact-us)" section below.


## Third-party websites and services

Our Privacy Policy does not apply to products or services offered by a third party. Depending on the Ourmoe product or service you use, it may incorporate third parties' products or services involving voice support, camera processing, video playback, system cleaning and security-related services, gaming, statistics, social media interaction, payment processing, map navigation, sharing, push, information filtering, input methods, etc. Some of these will be provided in the form of links to third parties' websites, and some will be accessed in the form of SDKs, APIs, etc. Your information may also be collected when you use these products or services. For this reason, we strongly suggest that you take the time to read the third party's privacy policy just like you read ours. We are not responsible for and cannot control how third parties use personal information which they collect from you. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to other sites linked from our services.

The following are examples of what third-party terms and privacy policies may apply when you use the specific products listed above:

When you use a third-party check-out service provider to finalize and pay for your order, the personal information that you provide during check out is handled in accordance with the third party's privacy policy.

When we analyze statistics, monitor the app crash rate, and provide cloud control capabilities, we use Google Analytics for Firebase or Firebase Analytics provided by Google, Inc. You can read more about the Google Firebase Privacy Policy:
