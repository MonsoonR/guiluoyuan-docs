# Ourmoe - Allowed Modifications / Minecraft


### Preface

Minecraft modifications are a large part of the Minecraft experience for many players, with modifications ranging from small performance and visual improvements right through to gameplay-altering ones. As Minecraft modifications provide such a wide range of functionality, not all modifications are permitted to be used on our server. This guide outlines what types of modifications we do allow on the server.


### Important Notes

Please be aware that once you use Minecraft mods on our server, you will bear the risks associated with using Minecraft mods. Make sure you have carefully read, fully understood, and unreservedly accepted this regulation before using Minecraft mods on our server.

This regulation cannot cover all Minecraft mods, and it cannot guarantee that any mod complies with Ourmoe community rules. If a Minecraft mod does not belong to any of the types listed below, it is assumed to not be allowed for use on our server.

All Minecraft mods you install should be obtained from official sources provided by the mod, such as the developer's personal website, GitHub, CurseForge, and Modrinth. Mods obtained from unofficial sources may not work as described by the mod's official information, may contain bugs or undisclosed features &#40;which could result in penalties on our server&#41;, and may even contain malicious content &#40;such as viruses, spyware, etc.&#41;.

If we find that a community member is using mod types explicitly prohibited by this regulation, that community member will be permanently banned from the Ourmoe and its associated servers. All permissions within the Ourmoe will be revoked, and the member's information will be recorded in the Ourmoe's internal blacklist.

Due to regulatory, protective, and gameplay reasons, we may prohibit players from logging into and playing on Losenone's open servers using certain Minecraft mod loaders &#40;including but not limited to Forge, Fabric, LiteLoader, Rift, Quilt, and NeoForge&#41;, Minecraft first-party clients, and third-party clients &#40;including but not limited to Badlion Client, Lunar Client&#41;.
